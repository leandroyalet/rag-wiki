# Adaptive Chunking: Optimizing Chunking-Method Selection for RAG

## Resumen
The effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is highly dependent on how documents are chunked, that is, segmented into smaller units for indexing and retrieval. Yet, commonly used "one-size-fits-all" approaches often fail to capture the nuanced structure and semantics of diverse texts. Despite its central role, chunking lacks a dedicated evaluation framework, making it difficult to assess and compare strategies independently of downstream performance. We challenge this paradigm by introducing Adaptive Chunking, a framework that selects the most suitable chunking strategy for each document based on a set of five novel intrinsic, document-based metrics: References Completeness (RC), Intrachunk Cohesion (ICC), Document Contextual Coherence (DCC), Block Integrity (BI), and Size Compliance (SC), which directly assess chunking quality across key dimensions. To support this framework, we also introduce two new chunkers, an LLM-regex splitter and a split-then-merge recursive splitter, alongside targeted post-processing techniques. On a diverse corpus spanning legal, technical, and social science domains, our metric-guided adaptive method significantly improves downstream RAG performance. Without changing models or prompts, our framework increases RAG outcomes, raising answers correctness to 72% (from 62-64%) and increasing the number of successfully answered questions by over 30% (65 vs. 49). These results demonstrate that adaptive, document-aware chunking, guided by a complementary suite of intrinsic metrics, offers a practical and effective path to more robust RAG systems.
